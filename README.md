    > - Add a commit message and **commit** the changes

5.  Send all the changes you've made to GitHub
    > **Push** changes to remote `origin`

6.  Send all the changes you've made to the MVP Heroku prototype
    > **Push** changes from to remote `heroku`

#### Replicate those changes into the Post-MVP Heroku prototype
1.  Switch to the Post-MVP branch
    > **Checkout** local `main` branch

2.  Merge the changes you made in the MVP branch into the Post-MVP branch
    > **Merge** changes from local `master` branch into local `main` branch
